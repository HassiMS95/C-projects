Based on my implementation of this assignment, I believe all functions are properly working the way they should be. Except, I'm not too confident that IO_thread() and thread_performance() are accurately correct based on different sources. I have had barely much time to solve the IO+thread() entirely. However, it may be because I have not implemented enough helper methods to insert the PCB into Ready_Q. Also I believe the thread_performance() method isn't entirely accurate either since I have no idea where to start and end certain timings, as well as incrementing the number of processes run.
