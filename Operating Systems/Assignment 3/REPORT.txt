I think everything I did is correct based on my understanding of the videos uploaded in order to guide me through the assignment. However, I'm not sure if the results are accurate enough based on the expected output.

3. Although all 3 files are compiled correctly and well, I'm not sure if I would be getting the same exact results based on the expected output from the assignment page.

4. The main challenge for this assignment was writing the helper methods for part2 and part3, as well as checking if everything is as written as it should for part1.
