Autumn Troy - large: Discussed how each algorithm would run based on assignment page, as well as what necessary methods/functions are needed to be called within int main().

Thomas Burns - medium: Discussed how to print every detail within int main() based on sample output.

I think everything I did is correct based on my understanding of each scheduling algorithm. However, I'm not sure if int main() would be executed correctly.

As mentioned above, I believe each scheduling algorithm should be working perfectly well based on the description of each part within the assignment.

4. The main challenge for this assignment was to test the output since I had trouble with running and compiling the program using MobaXterm. That said, I made a makefile based on my basic understanding of the structure from previous assignments.
